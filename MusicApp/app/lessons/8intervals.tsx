                        An <Text style={styles.bold}>interval</Text> is defined as the distance in pitch between two notes. An interval primarily measures two things:

                        can be melodic (played or sung separately) or harmonic (played or sung simultaneously). In the image below, the first
                        measure show a melodic interval between C & E while the second measure show a harmonic interval between the same pitches.

                        Every interval has a size & quality. A size is the distance between two notes on a staff, measured by the number of lines
                        & spaces between them. Sizes are written as numbers & are spoken as ordinal numbers (second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
                        seventh, etc.). Size must always be counted starting from 1. When two notes are on the same line or space, their interval
                        is called a unison. When two notes are eight lines & spaces apart, their interval is called an octave. Size is considered
                        generic. That means no matter what accidentals are applied to the notes of an interval, the size is always the same.

                        A quality makes an interval more specific when combined with size. Quality measures the distance between two notes more
                        specifically, and when combined with an interval's size, it describes the aural sound of the interval. There are five
                        possible qualities: <Text style={styles.bold}>Augmented</Text> (A), <Text style={styles.bold}>Major</Text> (M),
                        <Text style={styles.bold}>Perfect</Text> (P), <Text style={styles.bold}>Minor</Text> (m), <Text style={styles.bold}>Diminished</Text> (d).
                        The quality comes before the size when defining an interval. For example, an interval could be described as a "perfect
                        fourth" (P4), a "minor third" (m3), or an "augmented second" (A2). 2nds, 3rd, 6ths, & 7ths are major or minor intervals.
                        Unisons, 4ths, 5ths, & octaves are perfect intervals.

                        In the first example, the notes are F & C. First, the interval is a generic 5th (1: F, 2: G, 3: A, 4: B, 5: C). Second,
                        C is in the major scale of F. Therefore, this interval is a perfect 5th. In the second example, the notes are Eb & Cb.
                        First, the interval is a generic 6th (1: E, 2: F, 3: G, 4: A, 5: B, 6: C). Second, Cb is <i>not</i> in the major scale
                        of Eb, which has only 3 flats (Bb, Eb, Ab). Cb is a half-step below C, which is in the Eb major scale. Therefore, this
                        interval is a minor sixth.

                        <Text style={styles.bold}>Intervallic inversion</Text> occurs when two notes of an interval are flipped. For instance, an interval with C at the
                        bottom and E at the top can be inverted by moving the C up an octave. This is important because inverted intervals
                        share many interesting properties that can be useful to musicians, and intervallic inversion can be useful in determining
                        difficult intervals.

                        The sizes of inverted pairs always add up to 9. Unisons invert to octaves & octaves invert to unisons (1 + 8 = 9).
                        2nds invert to 7ths & 7ths invert to 2nds (2 + 7 = 9). 3rds invert to 6ths & 6ths invert to 3rds (3 + 6 = 9). 4ths
                        invert to 5ths & 5ths invert to 4ths (4 + 5 = 9).

                        The qualities of inverted pairs are opposites of each other. Perfect intervals invert to perfect intervals. Major
                        intervals invert to minor intervals & minor intervals invert to major intervals. Augmented intervals invert to diminished
                        intervals & diminished intervals invert to augmented intervals.

                        With that information, it is possible to calculate intervallic inversions without even looking at staff paper. A minor 7th
                        inverts to a major 2nd, an augmented 6th inverts to a diminished 3rd, and a perfect 4th inverts to a perfect 5th.

                        Intervallic inversion is also useful in determining difficult intervals. In the example below, identifying the interval
                        using the "Major Scale" method will not work since the bottom note is Ebb, which does not have a key signature. To determine
                        this interval, it would be useful to invert the interval to have Ab on the bottom and Ebb on the top. Ab does have a key
                        signature consisting of 4 flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db). An Eb above Ab would be a perfect 5th, but Ebb is a half-step smaller than
                        Eb, which means the interval between Ab & Ebb is a diminished 5th. With that in mind, we can simple invert this interval back
                        to the original interval using the properties of intervallic inversion. A diminished 5th inverts to an augmented 4th. Thus,
                        the interval between Ebb & Ab is an augmented 4th.
