                        Counting rhythms is incredibly important for any singer or instrumentalist. It will help you to perform music in the
                        right rhythms at a steady tempo. When counting beats in a measure of music, the note that gets the beat is counted with
                        numbers "1, 2, 3, 4". When a note lasts longer than a beat, the count is held over multiple beats. Beats that are not
                        counted are written in parentheses. When a beat in simple meter is divided in half, the divisions are counted aloud
                        with the syllable "and", which is notated by the + sign. So if a quarter note gets the beat, the second eighth note on
                        each beat will be counted as "and". Further subdivisions at the sixteenth note level are counted as "e" (pronounced "ee")
                        and "a" (pronounced "uh").

                        In simple meters with other beat units, like the half note, eighth note, or sixteenth note, the same counting pattern
                        is used to count beats and subdivisions. The only difference is they correspond to different note values. But the rhythms
                        sound the same and are counted the same.

                    <Text style={styles.text}>
                        When notating rhythms, it is important to beam notes together to show where the beat is. Quarter notes, half notes, and
                        whole notes do not need to be beamed, but eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and so on should be beamed together. In groups of
                        beamed notes, the stem direction is determined by the position of notes in the staff. For notes above the middle line, stems
                        point downward on the left side of the note, and for notes below the middle line, stems point upward on the right side of the note.
                        Stems on notes on the middle line can point in either direction, depending on the surrounding notes. In groups of two
                        beamed notes, the stem direction of both notes is determined by the note farthest from the middle line of the staff.

                        <Text style={styles.bold}>Compound Meter</Text> is a meter where the beat can be divided into three and then further subdivided in half. These
                        meters can be duple, triple, or quadruple, just like simple meters. The beats can be grouped into sets of two, three,
                        or four. The difference is that each beat divides into three divisions instead of two.

                        Measures in compound meter are equivalent to one group of beats, just like in simple meter. However, the two numbers
                        in the time signature have different meanings in compound meter. The top number represents the number of beat divisions
                        in a measure, and the bottom number represents which note value gets the division. The emphasis is on the beat divisions
                        rather than the beat itself.

                        Since the beat is divided into three in compound meter, the top number in the time signature is always a multiple of three.
                        Dividing this number by three yields the number of beats in the measure. The numbers 6, 9, & 12 correspond to duple, triple,
                        and quadruple meter respectively. The bottom number is usually 4 (meaning the quarter note gets the division), 8 (meaning the
                        eighth note gets the division), or 16 (meaning the sixteenth note gets the division).

                        Counting Compound Meter

                    <Text style={styles.text}>
                        Because the beats in compound meter divide into three, the beats are always represented by dotted notes. If 4 is the bottom
                        number, the beat is a dotted half note (three quarter notes). If 8 is the bottom number, the beat is a dotted quarter note (three
                        eighth notes). If 16 is the bottom number, the beat is a dotted eighth note (three sixteenth notes).

                        Just like in simple meter, the beat is counted in numbers "1, 2, 3, 4". When a note lasts longer than a beat, the count is still
                        held over and the beats not counted aloud are written in parentheses. Divisions are counted as "la" on the second division and
                        "li" on the third division. Further subdivisions at the sixteenth note level are counted as "ta" with the "la" & "li" syllables
                        staying consistent on the eighth note divisions.

                        Try counting the rhythm below. This example is in compound duple meter. The time signature 6/8 means that there are 2 beats
                        in every measure, and the dotted quarter note gets the beat while the eighth note gets the division.

                        In compound meters with other beat units, like the dotted half note or dotted eighth note the same counting pattern
                        is used to count beats and subdivisions. The only difference is they correspond to different note values. But the rhythms
                        sound the same and are counted the same.

                        When notating compound meter, it is still important to beam notes together to show where the beat is. Just like in simple
                        meter, only eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and so on should be beamed together. In groups of beamed notes, the rules for stem
                        direction are the same as in simple meter.
